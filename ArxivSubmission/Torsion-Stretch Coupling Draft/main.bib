It is highly elastic, shows large fracture strength and enables substantial energy dissipation during deformation. Most of the connective tissue in humans consists of collagen fibrils composed of a staggered array of tropocollagen molecules, which are connected by intermolecular cross-links. In this study, we report a three-dimensional coarse-grained model of collagen and analyze the influence of enzymatic cross-links on the mechanics of collagen fibrils. Two representatives immature and mature cross-links are implemented in the mesoscale model using a bottom-up approach. By varying the number, type and mechanical properties of cross-links in the fibrils and performing tensile test on the models, we systematically investigate the deformation mechanisms of cross-linked collagen fibrils. We find that cross-linked fibrils exhibit a three phase behavior, which agrees closer with experimental results than what was obtained using previous models. The fibril mechanical response is characterized by: (i) an initial elastic deformation corresponding to the collagen molecule uncoiling, (ii) a linear regime dominated by molecule sliding and (iii) the second stiffer elastic regime related to the stretching of the backbone of the tropocollagen molecules until the fibril ruptures. Our results suggest that both cross-link density and type dictate the stiffness of large deformation regime by increasing the number of interconnected molecules while cross-links mechanical properties determine the failure strain and strength of the fibril. These findings reveal that cross-links play an essential role in creating an interconnected fibrillar material of tunable toughness and strength.}, journal={Journal of the Mechanical Behavior of Biomedical Materials}, author={Depalle, Baptiste and Qin, Zhao and Shefelbine, Sandra J. and Buehler, Markus J.}, year={2015}, month={Dec}, pages={1–13} }

These biologically induced changes in bone quality at molecular level lead to changes both in bone matrix architecture and bone matrix composition. However, the quantitative details of changes in bone quality - and especially their link to reduced macroscale mechanical properties are still largely missing. In this study, a mouse model for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis (GIOP) was used to investigate mechanical and material alterations in bone cortex (natural nanocomposite) at different scale. By combining quantitative backscattered electron (qBSE) imaging, nanoindentation and high brilliance synchrotron X-ray nanomechanical imaging on a genetically modified mouse model of GIOP, we were able to quantify the local indentation modulus, mineralization distribution and the alterations of nanoscale structures and deformation mechanisms in the mid-diaphysis of femur, and relate them to the macroscopic mechanical changes. Our results showed clear and significant changes in terms of material quality of bone at nanoscale and microscale, which manifests itself in development of spatial heterogeneities in mineralization and indentation moduli across the bone organ, with potential implications for increased fracture risk.}, journal={Bone}, author={Xi, Li and Song, Yu and Wu, Wenwang and Qu, Zhaoliang and Wen, Jiawei and Liao, Binbin and Tao, Ran and Ge, Jingran and Fang, Daining}, year={2020}, pages={115334} }

Articular cartilage possesses an inhomogeneous structure throughout its thickness, driving the associated variation in the biomechanical strain profile within the tissue under physiological compressive loading. However, little is known experimentally about the nanostructural mechanical role of the collagen fibrils and how this varies with depth. Utilising a high-brilliance synchrotron X-ray source, we have measured the depth-wise nanostructural parameters of the collagen network in terms of the periodic fibrillar banding (D-period) and associated parameters. We show that there is a depth dependent variation in D-period reflecting the pre-strain and concurrent with changes in the level of intrafibrillar order. Further, prolonged static compression leads to fibrillar changes mirroring those caused by removal of extrafibrillar proteoglycans (as may occur in aging or disease). We suggest that fibrillar D-period is a sensitive indicator of localised changes to the mechanical environment at the nanoscale in soft connective tissues. Statement of Significance Collagen plays a significant role in both the structural and mechanical integrity of articular cartilage, allowing the tissue to withstand highly repetitive loading. However, the fibrillar mechanics of the collagen network in cartilage are not clear. Here we find that cartilage has a spatial gradient in the nanostructural collagen fibril pre-strain, with an increase in the fibrillar pre-strain with depth. Further, the fibrillar gradient changes similarly under compression when compared to an enzymatically degraded tissue which mimics age-related changes. Given that the fibrils potentially have a finite capacity to mechanically respond and alter their configuration, these findings are significant in understanding how collagen may alter in structure and gradient in diseased cartilage, and in informing the design of cartilage replacements.}, journal={Acta Biomaterialia}, author={Inamdar, Sheetal R. and Barbieri, Ettore and Terrill, Nicholas J. and Knight, Martin M. and Gupta, Himadri S.}, year={2019}, pages={437–450} }

To resist fracture, bone’s toughness is derived intrinsically through plasticity (e.g., fibrillar sliding) at structural scales typically below a micrometer and extrinsically (i.e., during crack growth) through mechanisms (e.g., crack deflection/bridging) generated at larger structural scales. Biological factors such as aging lead to a markedly increased fracture risk, which is often associated with an age-related loss in bone mass (bone quantity). However, we find that age-related structural changes can significantly degrade the fracture resistance (bone quality) over multiple length scales. Using in situ small-angle X-ray scattering and wide-angle X-ray diffraction to characterize submicrometer structural changes and synchrotron X-ray computed tomography and in situ fracture-toughness measurements in the scanning electron microscope to characterize effects at micrometer scales, we show how these age-related structural changes at differing size scales degrade both the intrinsic and extrinsic toughness of bone. Specifically, we attribute the loss in toughness to increased nonenzymatic collagen cross-linking, which suppresses plasticity at nanoscale dimensions, and to an increased osteonal density, which limits the potency of crack-bridging mechanisms at micrometer scales. The link between these processes is that the increased stiffness of the cross-linked collagen requires energy to be absorbed by “plastic” deformation at higher structural levels, which occurs by the process of microcracking.}, number={35}, journal={Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences}, author={Zimmermann, Elizabeth A. and Schaible, Eric and Bale, Hrishikesh and Barth, Holly D. and Tang, Simon Y. and Reichert, Peter and Busse, Bjoern and Alliston, Tamara and Ager, Joel W. and Ritchie, Robert O.}, year={2011}, pages={14416–14421} }

A transverse cross-section of a 12–14 year old beagle fibula was studied with 80.7keV radiation, and the transmission geometry was used to quantify internal strains and corresponding stresses in the mineral phase, carbonated hydroxyapatite. The diffraction patterns agreed with tabulated patterns, and the distribution of diffracted intensity around 00.2/00.4 and 22.2 diffraction rings was consistent with the imperfect 00.1 fiber texture expected along the axis of a long bone. Residual compressive stress along the bone’s longitudinal axis was observed in the specimen prior to testing: for 22.2 this stress equaled −95MPa and for 00.2/00.4 was between −160 and −240MPa. Diffraction patterns were collected for applied compressive stresses up to −110MPa, and, up to about −100MPa, internal stresses rose proportionally with applied stress but at a higher rate, corresponding to stress concentration in the mineral of 2.8 times the stress applied. The widths of the 00.2 and 00.4 diffraction peaks indicated that crystallite size perpendicular to the 00.1 planes increased from t=41nm before stress was applied to t=44nm at −118MPa applied stress and that rms strain εrms rose from 2200με before loading to 4600με at the maximum applied stress. Small angle X-ray scattering of the unloaded sample, recorded after deformation was complete, showed a collagen D-period of 66.4nm (along the bone axis).}, number={1}, journal={Journal of Structural Biology}, author={Almer, J.D. and Stock, S.R.}, year={2005}, pages={14–27} }
