%% Text of abstract
Collagen fibrils are the main structural component of load-bearing tissues such as tendons, ligaments, skin, the cornea of the eye, and the heart. The D-band of collagen fibrils is a periodic axial density modulation that can be easily characterized by tissue-level X-ray scattering. During mechanical testing, D-band strain is often used as a proxy for fibril strain. However, this approach ignores the coupling between strain and molecular tilt. We examine the validity of this approximation using an elastomeric collagen fibril model that includes both the D-band and a molecular tilt field. We show that the D-band strain substantially underestimates fibril strain for strongly twisted collagen fibrils -- such as fibrils from skin or corneal tissue.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Collagen-rich tissues such as skin, tendon, ligament, the cornea, and the heart all have complex hierarchical structures that support their load bearing function. The common building block is the collagen fibril, a chiral bundle of collagen molecules whose relative axial stagger gives rise to the D-band --  a characteristic axial density modulation \cite{Orgel:2006}. The D-band can be easily observed by electron microscopy \cite{Hodge:1960}, atomic force microscopy \cite{Fang:2013}, or X-ray scattering \cite{Sasaki:1996}. The D-band repeat is divided in two regions, the overlap region where all the molecules are present in the collagen fibril cross-section and the gap region where 80\% of the molecules are present \cite{Orgel:2006}. In vivo, the enzyme lysyl-oxidase (LOX) cross-links adjacent molecules in the gap region in order to increase tensile stability \cite{Orgel:2001,Makris:2014}. 

When studying the impact of mechanical deformations on the hierarchical structure of collagen-rich tissues, it is common practice to use changes in the D-band period as a proxy measure of the fibril-level strain \cite{Sasaki:1996, Misof:1997, Aziz:2018, Gautieri:2017, Gachon:2020}. This is based on the untested assumption that changes in the molecular density fluctuation follow fibril elongation in an affine manner. Underlying this assumption are two key conditions: (i) the density of LOX induced cross-links is sufficiently large  and homogeneous to yield a uniform strain field along the collagen fibril, and (ii) changes in collagen molecular orientation due to the axial strain are negligible. 

Hydrothermal isometric tension (HIT) relies on the thermal denaturation of collagen-rich tissues at constant tensile strain in order to reveal the connectivity of the network of cross-links within and between collagen fibrils \cite{Lous:1983}. This method confirms that ex vivo collagen tissues are well cross-linked \cite{Lous:1983, Allain:1980, Kampmeier:2000, Herod:2016} -- satisfying the first condition.

For the second condition to be met, the collagen molecular tilt with respect to the fibril axis must be small. This is probably true for tendon  fibrils where the molecular tilt at the fibrilâ€™s surface is no larger than $5^\circ$ and the D-band spacing is $66-67\mathrm{nm}$ \cite{Hulmes:1981, Quan:2015}. This is unlikely to be true for collagen fibrils in skin and cornea where the molecular tilt at the fibrilâ€™s surface can reach $15-20^\circ$ and the D-band spacing is typically $64-65\mathrm{nm}$ \cite{Raspanti:2018, Brodsky:1980}. The inverse relationship between surface molecular tilt and D-band spacing across tissue types can be explained geometrically by considering the projection of a collagen molecule along the fibril axis \cite{Cameron:2020, Bozec:2007}. However, for strained fibrils we must also consider the coupling between tilt and stretch that is often observed in helical assemblies such as actin filaments \cite{Tsuda:1996} or in single helical molecules such as DNA \cite{Sheinin:2009}.

In this work, we use liquid-crystalline elastomer theory to explore the effect of applied strain at the fibril level on both the D-band strain and the molecular tilt. Our collagen fibril model includes a sinusoidal axial density fluctuation giving rise to a global D-band spacing and a double-twist configuration for the molecular tilt \cite{Cameron:2020}. Torsion-stretch coupling is observed experimentally when stretching strips of corneal tissue \cite{Bell:2018} and is well-captured by our model. Stretching the elastomeric fibril shows that molecular tilt decreases rapidly with applied fibril strain while the D-band spacing only increases moderately.

\section{Continuum theory for a cross-linked collagen fibril}
\label{sec:theory}
We have recently proposed two continuum models for the formation and structure of unstrained collagen fibrils which considered fibril growth either in equilibrium before cross-linking occurs \cite{Cameron:2020} or out of equilibrium where cross-linking occurs during growth \cite{Leighton:2021}. Both models are based on a coarse-grained free energy that accounts for distortions in the molecular orientation field (via a Frank free energy), periodic density modulations (via phase-field crystal theory), and surface effects. The orientation of collagen molecules within a fibril is parametrized by a radius-dependent twist angle $\psi(r)$ at which molecules are tilted with respect to the fibril axis.

We approximate the D-band as a single-mode sinusoidal density modulation with spacing (wavelength) $d$:
\begin{equation}
\rho(z)  \propto \cos(2 \pi z/d),
\end{equation}
where the $z$ coordinate is aligned along the fibril axis.
Using phase-field crystal theory with this single-mode approximation, the free-energy density averaged over one wavelength is \cite{Cameron:2020, Leighton:2021}
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
f_D & \propto \left(1 - \left( \frac{d_{||}}{d} \right)^2 \cos^2\psi\right)^2,
\end{aligned} \label{dband}
\end{equation}
where $d_\parallel \approx 67\mathrm{nm}$ is the equilibrium D-band period in the absence of molecular twist. Here we only show the energetic contribution from the D-band spacing \cite{Cameron:2020, Leighton:2021}.

When the molecular twist field $\psi \neq 0$, we cannot minimize the volume-average free-energy using  $d=d_{||}$.  Instead, the D-band spacing that  minimizes the fibril free energy is \cite{Leighton:2021}
\begin{equation}\label{DBandPeriod}
\frac{d}{d_{||}} = \left( \frac{\left\langle \cos^4\psi\right\rangle}{\left\langle \cos^2\psi\right\rangle}\right)^{1/2},
\end{equation}
where angled brackets denote the volume average -- with $\langle \cdot\rangle = 2 \int_0^R \cdot r dr /R^2$. 

Both the D-band period $d_0$ of an unstrained fibril (with $\lambda=1$ and twist angle function $\psi_0(r)$) and the D-band period $d$ of a strained fibril (with strained twist-angle function $\psi(r)$) should satisfy Eqn.~\ref{DBandPeriod}. Accordingly, we can obtain the D-band strain, $\epsilon_D$:
\begin{equation} \label{dbandstraineq}
\epsilon_D \equiv \frac{d-d_0}{d_0}  =\left( \frac{\left\langle \cos^4\psi\right\rangle\left\langle \cos^2\psi_0\right\rangle}{\left\langle \cos^2\psi\right\rangle\left\langle \cos^4\psi_0\right\rangle}\right)^{1/2}-1, 
\end{equation}
where we express $\epsilon_D$ solely in terms of the strained and unstrained twist-angle functions.

When the fibril is strained axially, we can apply elastomeric theory \cite{Warner:1996} to the cross-linked fibril to determine the strained twist function $\psi(r)$ from  the fibril stretch ratio $\lambda$ and the initial twist function $\psi_0(r)$. Assuming that the elastomeric free energy dominates the Frank and D-band free energies \cite{Leighton:2021}, we can minimize the elastomeric free energy to determine the equilibrium strained configuration. This minimization can be performed analytically \cite{Leighton:2021b}, and yields
\begin{equation}\label{psieq}
    \psi(r) = \frac{1}{2}\cot^{-1}\left( \frac{ (\zeta+1)(\lambda^3-1) + (\zeta-1)(\lambda^3+1)\cos(2\psi_0)}{2\lambda^{3/2}(\zeta-1)\sin(2\psi_0)} \right)
\end{equation}
The parameter $\zeta$ quantifies the anisotropy of the intermolecular cross-links; it is defined as the ratio between the mean lengths of cross-links in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the molecular director field ($\hat{\boldsymbol{n}} = -\sin\psi(r) \boldsymbol{\hat{\phi}} + \cos\psi(r) \boldsymbol{\hat{z}}$ in cylindrical coordinates). Any value of $\zeta\geq0$ could in theory be realized in an elastomer system, however $\zeta>1$ is generally assumed in modelling approaches \cite{Warner:1996,Warner:2000} and observed experimentally for nematic liquid crystals \cite{DAllest:1988,Kundler:1998}. For extensional fibril strains (corresponding to $\lambda>1$) we predict that the molecular twist $\psi$ decreases (increases) when $\zeta>1$ ($\zeta<1$). Since molecular twist of collagen molecules has been observed experimentally to decrease when fibrils are axially extended \cite{Bell:2018}, we restrict ourselves to $\zeta>1$.

To summarize, for a given unstrained twist angle function $\psi_0(r)$, we can compute as a function of the fibril strain $\epsilon_F = \lambda-1$ the post-strain twist angle function $\psi(r)$ (using Eqn.~\ref{psieq}) and the D-band strain $\epsilon_D$ (using Eqn.~\ref{dbandstraineq}). These calculations depend only on a single parameter, the cross-link anisotropy $\zeta$. We can compute solutions to Eqns.~\ref{dbandstraineq} and \ref{psieq} numerically for arbitrary $\psi_0$, $\zeta$, and $\epsilon_F$ using code we have made publically available on GitHub \cite{github}. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Small angle limit}
Under extension (with $\lambda>1$) and with small initial twist angles the strained twist angle function Eqn.~\ref{psieq} is approximately given by \cite{Leighton:2021b}
\begin{equation}\label{smallangle}
\psi(r) \simeq \psi_0(r) (\zeta-1)\left(\zeta\lambda^{3/2} - \lambda^{-3/2}\right)^{-1}.
\end{equation}
We can use this approximation to obtain a small-angle approximation for the D-band strain $\epsilon_D$ as a function of the initial and strained volume-averaged twist angle functions:
\begin{equation}\label{DbandStrain}
\epsilon_D \simeq \frac{1}{2}\left[ 1 - \left( \frac{\langle \psi\rangle}{\langle\psi_0\rangle}\right)^2\right]\left\langle \psi_0^2\right\rangle.
\end{equation}
Alternatively, we can write $\epsilon_D$
in terms of the fibril stretch ratio $\lambda= 1 + \epsilon_F$ as
\begin{equation}\label{DbandvsFibril}
\epsilon_D \simeq \frac{1}{2}\left[ 1 - \left( \frac{\zeta - 1}{\zeta\lambda^{3/2} - \lambda^{-3/2}}\right)^2\right]\left\langle \psi_0^2\right\rangle.
\end{equation}

%General Features of Eq. 7:
From Eq. \ref{DbandStrain} we see that $\epsilon_D$ increases monotonically as $\langle\psi\rangle$ decreases due to molecules untwisting. This function is concave ($\partial^2 \epsilon_D/\partial \langle\psi\rangle^2\leq0$), so that the D-band strain grows faster when the molecular twist is higher. For large strains the molecular tilt will disappear ($\psi\to 0$), and thus the D-band strain asymptotically approaches the value $\langle\psi_0^2\rangle/2$ in the small angle limit, and $\left[\langle\cos^2\psi_0\rangle/\langle\cos^4\psi_0\rangle\right]^{1/2} - 1$ more generally. 

Eq.~\ref{DbandvsFibril} has simple asymptotic behavior as a function of $\zeta$. When  $\zeta$ approaches $1$ from above, the D-band strain is 
\begin{equation}
\epsilon_D = \begin{cases} 
0, & \epsilon_F=0\\
\frac{1}{2}\langle\psi_0^2\rangle, & \epsilon_F>0.
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
When $\zeta\to\infty$ we have $\epsilon_D = \frac{1}{2}\left(1 - \lambda^{-3}\right)\langle\psi_0^2\rangle$. In the small angle limit the D-band strain is always a monotonically increasing ($\partial \epsilon_D/\partial\epsilon_F \geq0$) and concave ($\partial^2 \epsilon_D/\partial\epsilon_F^2 \leq0$) function of fibril strain, as long as $\zeta>1$ and $\epsilon_F>0$.  Monotonicity and concavity also hold (not shown) for the more general D-band strain function given by Eq.~\ref{dbandstraineq}.

\subsection{D-band strain vs fibril strain}\label{cornealcompare}

Our small-angle approximations in Eqns.~\ref{DbandStrain} and \ref{DbandvsFibril} are useful for comparing with experimental data. Even for collagen fibrils with relatively high surface twist, such as the $\psi_0(R)\approx 0.3$ observed in corneal fibrils, the small angle approximation applies since we expect that the twist-angle function monotonically decreases from the surface \cite{Cameron:2020, Leighton:2021}. In general, the full twist angle function $\psi_0(r)$ is unknown, and only the surface twist $\psi_0(R)$ and the volume-averaged twist $\langle \psi_0\rangle$ can be measured. Nevertheless, we can treat $\langle\psi_0^2\rangle$ as an adjustable parameter.

%Discussion of Fig 1 and Bell Paper
Fig.~\ref{fig:dbandstrain}A shows how the volume-averaged twist angle decreases with D-band strain in the small-angle limit (Eqn.~\ref{DbandStrain}), for different values of $\langle\psi_0^2\rangle$. We also show experimental data from \cite{Bell:2018} (green crosses), which reported measurements of both D-band strain and corresponding changes in volume-averaged molecular tilt for strained corneal tissue. We find that our model  fits the data with $\langle\psi_0^2\rangle\approx 0.01\mathrm{rad}^2$. 

Fig.~\ref{fig:dbandstrain}B then shows D-band strain vs fibril strain curves (as given by Eqn.~\ref{DbandvsFibril}) for different values of $\zeta$. Different values of $\zeta$ can lead to a variety of curves. We can compare with experimental data from \cite{Bell:2018} here as well, which we show with green crosses (measurements of D-band strain are  scaled by our estimated value of $\langle\psi_0^2\rangle$). Under the assumption that the fibril strain is equal to the reported tissue strain, we find good agreement with our model predictions for $\zeta\approx1.3$. Fibril strain could be smaller than tissue (applied) strain if fibrils are not perfectly aligned with the applied strain -- or if there is  slippage between fibrils \cite{Screen:2004}. Accordingly, we expect $\zeta\in[1,1.3]$ for corneal fibrils. 

We can use Eq.~\ref{DbandvsFibril} to compare the D-band and fibril strains. For extensional fibril strains ($\epsilon_F>0$), the D-band strain will always underestimate the fibril strain when $\langle\psi_0^2\rangle <(2/3) (\zeta-1)/(\zeta+1)$. This is generally true for small tilt angles.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Soft D-band}
We have assumed that the D-band is energetically soft (subdominant) under the axial extension of collagen fibrils. This assumption is needed to be able to use the elastomeric theory to determine $\psi(r)$ (via Eqn.~\ref{psieq}), with the D-band strain then determined from $\psi$ using Eqn.~\ref{dbandstraineq}. While there are no direct measurements of the D-band modulus $Y$, we can estimate it from observed variations of the D-band spacing if we assume that they correspond to equilibrium fluctuations. From Eqn.~\ref{dband} and including constant factors we have \cite{Cameron:2020}
\begin{equation}
    \frac{\sigma^2_d}{d^2} = \frac{k_B T}{\pi R^2 d Y},
\end{equation}
where the left-side is the fractional variance of D-band spacing, while the right-side includes $k_B$ Boltzmann's constant, the temperature $T$, fibril radius $R$, and the Young's modulus $Y$. 

Using $\sigma^2_d/d^2 \simeq 10^{-4}$ and $R \simeq 50\mathrm{nm}$ for collagen fibrils \cite{Fang:2012,Fang:2013B}, $k_B T \simeq 4.1 \mathrm{pN nm}$ and $d \simeq 67\mathrm{nm}$, we estimate $Y \simeq 80 \mathrm{kPa}$ for the D-band Young's modulus. We compare this with $Y \gtrsim 100\mathrm{MPa}$ for cross-linked collagen fibrils \cite{Graham:2004}, and we confirm that the D-band appears to have negligible stiffness compared to the fibril.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
Using an elastomeric model for cross-linked double-twist fibrils, combined with a subdominant phase-field model for axial (D-band) modulations that are coupled with the double-twist, we have shown how the D-band strain $\epsilon_D$ is typically much less than the fibril strain $\epsilon_F$ under axial extension. We have limited our results to the small-angle regime appropriate for collagen fibrils, but our results are qualitatively similar for larger twist angles. In validation, we have shown how experimental data on collagen fibrils from corneal tissue are well fit by our results. 

Experimentally, measuring changes in D-band spacing requires small angle X-ray scattering \cite{Sasaki:1996, Gautieri:2017} (SAXS) while measuring molecular tilt can be achieved by analyzing the angular dependency of the radial molecular spacing using wide angle X-ray scattering (WAXS) \cite{Bell:2018}. With our model, it is now possible to fit the relationship between average twist ($\langle \psi \rangle$) and D-band strain ($\epsilon_D$) to estimate the true fibril strain ($\epsilon_F$). In the process, we also estimate two new quantities for corneal collagen fibrils: the cross-linking anisotropy parameter $\zeta \simeq 1.3$ and the volume-average square of the tilt-angle $\langle \psi_0^2 \rangle \simeq 0.01$. 

%skin
A similar tilt-stretch coupling should also occur in skin where the D-band spacing is $65\mathrm{nm}$ \cite{Brodsky:1980} and the surface molecular tilt reaches $17^\circ$ \cite{Ottani:2001, Mechanic:1987}. Notch testing has shown that skin resists tearing by stretching the fibrils perpendicular to the propagation direction of the tear \cite{Yang:2015}. For these fibrils the D-band spacing increases up to $67\mathrm{nm}$ before failure starts to occur at $3\%$ D-band strain \cite{Yang:2015}. This limiting D-band spacing equals the unstrained value observed in tendon \cite{Quan:2015}.  $\langle \psi \rangle$ has not yet been measured in this tissue. Nevertheless, our results indicate that the $3\%$ D-band strain at failure may correspond to significantly larger fibril strains. 

% tendon
When the surface molecular twist is smaller than $5^\circ$, as in tendon fibrils \cite{Hulmes:1981}, strain-straightening of molecules is not a significant deformation mechanism. Indeed, based on geometrical considerations, deformation via molecular untwisting can only accommodate strains up to  $\epsilon_\mathrm{untwist}^\mathrm{max}=\sec\left[\psi_0(R)\right]-1$. While this limit can be as high as $5-6\%$ strain in highly twisted corneal tissue, it is less than half a percent for the small molecular twist of tendon fibrils. We thus expect that the torsion-stretch coupling described here is negligible in tendon, and D-band strain should be a good measure of fibril strain. Human, bovine and rat tendon fibrils have an extensibility before failure of between $20$ and $30\%$ \cite{Quigley:2018, Svensson:2013}. This is similar to the largest D-band strains  -- $20\%$ -- observed for bovine and rat tendon fibrils stretched on an elastic substrate \cite{Gachon:2020, Peacock:2019}. In order to achieve such large strains without losing the molecular density fluctuation responsible for the D-band spacing, tendon fibrils must deform by a combination of molecular sliding \cite{Gautieri:2017, Peacock:2019} and/or molecular stretching \cite{Iqbal:2019} -- mechanisms that we have not modelled here. 

Given the variety of collagen fibril surface tilts observed, it is interesting to consider the possible functional advantages of having a larger molecular tilt. One possibility is that the molecular tilt acts as a reversible deformation mechanism at low fibril strains -- much as the low-stiffness toe-region of tissue elasticity arises from crimp removal \cite{Fratzl:1998}. This could protect structured collagenous tissue in the low-strain regime. An additional example of this protective mechanism could be in the chordae that control the position of valve leaflets in the heart \cite{Ross:2020}. The chordae contain both collagen fibrils and elastin fibres arranged in a multi-layered cylindrical structure \cite{Millington:1998}. Static measurements show that the collagen fibrils have a D-band spacing of $65\mathrm{nm}$ and an average molecular twist angle of $9^\circ$ or $0.15$ radians \cite{Folkhard:1987}. This is half the value observed in the cornea, but significantly larger than in tendon.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusion}
While the molecular twist of a collagen fibril is difficult to observe experimentally, our model shows that twist can have a large impact on the elastic properties of a fibril. We have shown that torsion-stretch coupling leads to D-band strains substantially smaller than fibril strains. This torsion-stretch coupling could enable fibrils in the cornea, the chordae and the skin to delay the onset of plastic deformation that can occur at small D-band strains \cite{Gautieri:2017}. Significant molecular tilt in these tissues may have evolved to increase their resistance to damage due to cyclic loading.

While the direct applications of our results are to collagen fibrils, they should also apply to other double-twisted filaments with axial modulations such as keratin macrofibrils in hair and wool \cite{Kreplak:2002, Harland:2014}.
