# Project: Torsion-Stretch Coupling in Collagen Fibrils


This repository contains all the electronic material (code, figures, etc) needed to replicate the findings of the manuscript titled "D-band strain underestimates collagen fibril strain" by Matthew P Leighton, Andrew D Rutenberg, and Laurent Kreplak. In particular, the contents include:

## Figures
This folder contains pdf copies of the single figure that is included in the manuscript.

## Code
This folder contains the python script (Fig1.py) used to produce the figure in the manuscript. The script is straightforward, and just plots equations derived in the text of the manuscript. We also include a second script (General_Functions.py) which contains only functions used to numerically compute solutions to select equations derived in the manuscript.
