This repository contains all the electronic material (code, data, etc) needed to replicate the findings of the manuscript titled "Chiral phase-coexistence in compressed double-twist elastomers" by Matthew P Leighton, Andrew D Rutenberg, and Laurent Kreplak. In particular, the contents include:

## Figures
This folder contains pdf copies of the single figure that is included in the manuscript.

## Figure_Code
This folder contains python scripts used to produce each of the figures in the manuscript. Scripts are straightforward, and primarily just plot equations derived in the text of the manuscript. The only non-trivial code is a set of functions that calculate the coexistence points of a common tangent construction for a non-convex free energy functionc (for figures 2,3, and 4). Note that the script 'Fig2.py' must be run in a specific data subfolder, which is indicated by comments in the script. An additional subfolder contains old, poorly documented scripts used for calculating other quantities of interest not included in the manuscript.
